QR Outerloop PID Package

This package contains nodes for quadrotor control. All of the nodes implement
the outerloop of the common cascade control architecture on quadrotors. That is,
the outerloop controller takes in the desired position (x, y, z) and yaw
commands and outputs roll, pitch, yaw_rate, and collective thrust commands.

For translational control (x and y positions), PID controllers map the position
error to desired accelerations. A nonlinear inversion is used to relate the
desired accelerations and current thrust command to commanded roll and pitch
angles.

For thrust control, a PID controller maps the z-position error to the desired
thrust. The thrust is also boosted to compensate for roll and pitch.

Several command types are accepted. See the wave_msgs::QRControl message for
details.

All nodes must conform to this top-level package description.

Node(s):
  -pelican_outerloop_pid

All nodes subscribe to:
  - wave/qr_control_command [wave_msgs::QRControl]: specifies the quadrotor
      command
  - wave/qr_state_estimate [wave_msgs::QRStateEstimate]: message that specifies
      the current quadrotor states.

Launch file parameters:
  - xy_P [double] - Sets the translational position control proportional
      gain. Default: 3.3 [(m/s^2) / m]

  - xy_I [double] - Sets the translational position control integral
      gain. Default: 0.3

  - xy_D [double] - Sets the translational position control derivative
      gain. Default: 1.9

  - alt_P [double] - Sets the height control proportional gain.
      Default:  [N/m]

  - alt_I [double] - Sets the height control integral gain. Default: 

  - alt_D [double] - Sets the height control derivative gain. Default: 

  - yaw_P [double] - Sets the yaw control proportional gain. Default: 0.8

  - yaw_I [double] - Sets the yaw control integral gain. Default: 0.0

  - yaw_D [double] - Sets the yaw control derivative gain. Default: 0.3

  - max_rp_angle [double] - Sets the maximum roll/pitch command, in degrees.
      Default: 30.0


============================================================
pelican_outerloop_pid node
============================================================
Outputs of the controller are published to the asctec_mav_framework, which
relays the commands to the LLP of an asctec quadrotor.

Note: All four control loops (x, y, yaw, and thrust) are always running in this
  node. Manual control for individual control loops can be set in the
  asctec_mav_framework's asctec_hl_interface node.
